   ```python
   # Run via Celery/APScheduler
   await analytics_engine.batch_track_analytics(
       period_start=hour_start,
       period_end=hour_end,
       period_type="hour"
   )
   ```

2. **Alert Checking**: Run every 1-5 minutes to check alert rules
   ```python
   incidents = await monitoring_service.check_alert_rules()
   ```

3. **Health Checks**: Run every 1-5 minutes for all services
   ```python
   for service in services:
       await monitoring_service.check_service_health(
           service_name=service.name,
           service_type=service.type,
           check_function=service.check_func
       )
   ```

4. **Metric Cleanup**: Run weekly to delete old metrics
   ```python
   deleted = await metrics_service.cleanup_old_metrics(days=90)
   ```
