Sprint 1.2: Trust & Reputation System + Auto-Deploy

üéØ CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SPRINT 1.2 COMPLETE

## New Features

### 1. Dynamic Trust Scoring System
- Multi-factor trust algorithm (success 40%, latency 20%, ratings 20%, uptime 10%, consistency 10%)
- Replaces hardcoded 0.8 with real performance-based scores
- Returns 0.0-1.0 trust score calculated from agent metrics
- File: backend/services/reputation.py (367 lines)

### 2. Badge Achievement System
- 10+ performance badges (Elite üèÜ, Verified Pro ‚≠ê, Lightning Fast ‚ö°, etc.)
- Automatic badge awards based on performance thresholds
- Gamification to encourage agent excellence

### 3. Smart Contract Awarding
- User preference-based bid selection
- Weighted scoring: price + performance + speed + reputation
- Filters: max_price, min_confidence, max_latency, min_reputation
- File: backend/services/db_mesh.py (350 lines)

### 4. Reputation API Endpoints
- GET /api/v1/marketplace/agents/{id}/trust-score
- GET /api/v1/marketplace/agents/{id}/reputation
- GET /api/v1/marketplace/leaderboard
- File: backend/api/marketplace.py (updated)

### 5. Automatic Railway Deployment
- Auto-run migrations on deployment
- File: railway_migrate.sh (new)
- File: railway.json (updated)

## Database Changes

### New Migration
- File: backend/database/migrations/versions/2025_10_25_1500_add_mesh_protocol_tables.py
- Creates 8 tables: contracts, bids, deliveries, user_preferences, agent_metrics, agent_trust_scores, a2a_conversations, a2a_messages
- Will run automatically on Railway deployment

### Models Extended
- File: backend/database/models.py
- Added 8 mesh protocol models with relationships

## Documentation

- SPRINT_1_PROGRESS.md - Detailed progress report
- ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md - Visual system architecture
- RAILWAY_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md - Manual migration steps
- AUTO_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md - Automatic deployment guide
- SPRINT_1_2_COMPLETE.md - Completion summary

## Technical Details

### Trust Score Calculation
```python
trust_score = (
    (success_rate * 0.40) +
    (latency_score * 0.20) +
    (rating_score * 0.20) +
    (uptime_score * 0.10) +
    (consistency_score * 0.10)
)
```

### Deployment Flow
1. Push to GitHub
2. Railway detects commit
3. Builds app (pip install)
4. Runs migrations (alembic upgrade head)
5. Starts server (uvicorn)
6. ‚úÖ Live with new tables!

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run test suite
python -m pytest backend/services/reputation.py

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/marketplace/leaderboard
```

### Production Testing (After Deploy)
```bash
curl https://hermes-production.railway.app/api/v1/marketplace/leaderboard
```

## Impact

- ‚ùå Before: Fake trust scores (agent_trust_score = 0.8)
- ‚úÖ After: Real performance-based trust scores

- ‚ùå Before: Manual railway migration commands
- ‚úÖ After: Automatic migration on git push

- ‚ùå Before: No way to distinguish agent quality
- ‚úÖ After: Trust grades (A+ to D), badges, leaderboard

## Sprint Progress

‚úÖ Sprint 1.1: PostgreSQL Schema (COMPLETE)
‚úÖ Sprint 1.2: Trust & Reputation (COMPLETE)
üîú Sprint 1.3: Authentication & Security
üîú Sprint 1.4: Real-time WebSocket
üîú Sprint 1.5: Payment System (Stripe)

## Next Steps

1. Push to GitHub (migration runs automatically)
2. Verify deployment in Railway dashboard
3. Test new endpoints
4. Start Sprint 1.3 (Auth & Security)

## Quick Copy-Paste

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Sprint 1.2: Trust & Reputation System + Auto-Deploy

- Added dynamic trust scoring with 5-factor algorithm
- Added badge achievement system (10+ badges)
- Added smart contract awarding based on user preferences
- Added 3 reputation API endpoints
- Added automatic Railway deployment with migrations
- Created 8 new database tables via migration
- Extended database models for mesh protocol
- Comprehensive documentation (5 new .md files)

Migration will run automatically on Railway deployment.
Test: curl /api/v1/marketplace/leaderboard"

git push origin main
```

---

## After Pushing

Watch Railway logs:
```bash
railway logs --follow
```

Look for:
```
‚úÖ Running database migrations...
‚úÖ Migrations completed successfully!
‚úÖ Server running on port 8000
```

Then test:
```bash
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/v1/marketplace/leaderboard
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "metric": "trust_score",
  "leaderboard": []
}
```
