## 🔴 CRITICAL - Production Blockers

### 1. **Agent Trust Score & Reputation System**
**Status**: Hardcoded to 0.8  
**File**: `backend/mesh/contracts.py:183`  
**What's missing**:
- Track agent performance metrics (success rate, avg latency, quality)
- Calculate reputation score dynamically (0.0-1.0)
- Store historical performance data
- Penalize failed/slow deliveries
- Reward consistent high-quality agents
- Display trust badges on agent cards

**Implementation**:
```python
class ReputationManager:
    def calculate_trust_score(agent_id: str) -> float:
        # Success rate (40%)
        # Average latency vs promised (20%)
        # User ratings (20%)
        # Time on network (10%)
        # Dispute resolution (10%)
```

**Impact**: Users currently can't trust agent rankings! 🚨

---

### 2. **Database Persistence (PostgreSQL + Qdrant)**
**Status**: Everything in-memory (loses data on restart)  
**What's missing**:
- PostgreSQL schema for agents, contracts, bids, users, preferences
- Qdrant vector database for semantic capability search
- Migration scripts (Alembic)
- Connection pooling
- Backup strategy

**Tables needed**:
```sql
-- Critical tables
users, agents, capabilities, contracts, bids, deliveries
user_preferences, agent_reputation, conversations, messages
payment_transactions, dispute_logs, agent_metrics
```

**Impact**: Can't scale, no data retention, no analytics! 🚨

---

### 3. **Payment System & Escrow**
**Status**: Fake settlement (no real money)  
**What's missing**:
- Stripe/PayPal integration
- Escrow smart contracts (hold funds until delivery)
- Agent wallet system
- Withdrawal mechanism
- Transaction history
- Refund/dispute handling
- Tax reporting (1099 generation)

**Flow**:
```
User deposits $10 → Escrow holds funds → Contract awarded
→ Agent delivers → Validation → Release $8 to agent, $2 platform fee
```

**Impact**: No monetization, agents work for free! 💸

---

### 4. **Real-Time WebSocket for Agents**
**Status**: Agents poll contracts (inefficient)  
**What's missing**:
- WebSocket server for agent connections
- Push contract announcements to listening agents
- Heartbeat/keepalive for agent availability
- Reconnection logic
- Message queue (NATS/RabbitMQ) for reliability

**Current**: Agent polls every 2s (wasteful)  
**Needed**: Push notifications when contract created

**Impact**: High latency, poor UX, server load! ⚡

---

### 5. **Authentication & Authorization**
**Status**: No auth on preference endpoints  
**What's missing**:
- JWT validation on ALL mesh endpoints
- API keys for agents
- Rate limiting per user/agent
- Role-based access control (user vs agent vs admin)
- OAuth2 for third-party integrations

**Risks**:
- Anyone can set anyone's preferences
- No agent authentication (spoofing possible)
- DDoS vulnerable

**Impact**: Security nightmare! 🔒

---

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY - User Experience

### 6. **User Preference UI**

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY - Advanced Features

### 11. **Agent Collaboration Workflows**
**Status**: Agents don't coordinate on single contract  
**What's missing**:
- Multi-agent contracts (e.g., "Plan Tokyo trip" needs Flight + Hotel + Restaurant)
- Dependency chains (Hotel can't book until Flight confirmed)
- Partial failures (Flight succeeds, Hotel fails → what now?)
- Rollback mechanisms
- Agent handoffs (Agent A starts, Agent B finishes)

**Example**:
```
Contract: "Plan 3-day Tokyo trip"
├─ FlightAgent → Find flights ✅
├─ HotelAgent → Book hotel (depends on flight dates) ✅
├─ RestaurantAgent → Find restaurants near hotel ✅
└─ EventAgent → Find events during trip ❌ FAILED
   → System offers alternative or refund
```

**Status**: No disputes possible  
**What's missing**:
- Users can flag bad results
- Agents can dispute false flags
- Admin review queue
- Refund workflow
- Automatic quality checks (e.g., flight price validation)
- Appeals process

**Flow**:
```
User: "This hotel price is wrong!"

→ Decision: Full refund / Partial / Reject
```

**Impact**: No accountability!

---

### 13. **Agent Testing & Sandbox**
**Status**: Agents deploy directly to production  
**What's missing**:
- Test mode for agent development
- Sandbox contracts (fake payments)
- Agent validation suite (run test cases before approval)
- Performance benchmarking
- Error rate monitoring

**Developer Experience**:
```python
agent = MyAgent()
agent.register(mode="sandbox")  # Test environment
agent.run_tests()  # Automated validation
# 10/10 tests passed ✅
agent.deploy(mode="production")  # Go live
```

**Impact**: Broken agents deployed to users!

---

---

### 17. **SLA & Performance Guarantees**
**Status**: No guarantees  
**What's missing**:
- Agents can offer SLAs (99.9% uptime, <2s response)
- Penalty system if SLA violated
- Uptime monitoring
- Performance dashboards
- Guaranteed response times

**Example**:
```
PremiumFlightAgent:
- SLA: 99.9% uptime
- Avg response: 1.2s
- Penalty: 50% refund if >5s or fails
```

**Impact**: Enterprise users won't trust!

---

### 18. **Agent Versioning & Rollback**
**Status**: Agent updates break live contracts  
**What's missing**:
- Version control for agent deployments
- Blue-green deployments
- Gradual rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)
- Automatic rollback on errors
- Changelog tracking

**Flow**:
```
Agent v2.0 deployed

[1.2s] Returned top 5 results ✅
```

**Impact**: Users don't trust results!

---

$ hermes deploy --env staging
$ hermes promote --env production
```

**Impact**: Hard to build agents!

---

### 27. **API Rate Limiting & Quotas**
