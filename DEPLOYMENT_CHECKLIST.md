### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app
```

Set in Vercel:
```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production
# Enter your Railway URL
```

### Deploy
- [ ] Build locally first: `npm run build` (verify no errors)

- [ ] Build succeeded
- [ ] Deployment URL saved: `________________________`

### Verification
- [ ] Site loads
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Can reach login page
- [ ] Static assets loading

---

## üîÑ Connect Frontend & Backend

### Update Backend CORS
```bash
# Set Vercel URL in Railway
railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Redeploy
railway up
```

- [ ] CORS updated with Vercel URL
- [ ] Backend redeployed

### End-to-End Test
- [ ] Open Vercel URL in browser
- [ ] Register new account
- [ ] Login successful
- [ ] Send chat message
- [ ] WebSocket connects
- [ ] Real-time updates work
- [ ] Marketplace loads (if implemented)

---

## üîê Security Post-Deployment

- [ ] Change default admin password
  - Old: `admin@hermes.ai` / `admin123`
  - New: `________________________`

- [ ] Verify JWT secret is random (not default)
- [ ] HTTPS working on both domains
- [ ] CORS only allows your Vercel URL
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled (if implemented)
- [ ] Database backups configured

---

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### Railway
- [ ] Check logs: `railway logs`
- [ ] Monitor CPU/memory in dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerts (optional)

### Vercel
- [ ] Check deployment logs
- [ ] Monitor analytics (optional)
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)

### Database
- [ ] PostgreSQL accessible
- [ ] Redis responding
- [ ] Backup strategy in place

---

## ü§ñ Agent Network Setup

### Register First Agent
```bash
# Test agent registration endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/v1/agents/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "TestAgent",
    "endpoint": "https://test-agent.example.com/a2a",
    "description": "Test agent",
    "capabilities": ["test"],
    "category": "development",
    "is_free": true
  }'
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs

# Common issues:
- Missing environment variable
- Database connection failed
- Invalid GOOGLE_API_KEY
```

### Frontend can't connect
```bash
# Check CORS
curl -I https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/health

# Verify env variable
vercel env ls
```

### Database connection errors
```bash
# Test connection
railway shell
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Run migrations
python scripts/init_database.py
```

### WebSocket not connecting
```bash
# Check WebSocket URL in frontend
# Should be wss:// for HTTPS
# Verify Railway WebSocket support (it does!)
```

## ‚úÖ Deployment Complete!

Once all items are checked:

üéâ **Your decentralized agent network is LIVE!**

- ‚úÖ Backend: `https://________________________.up.railway.app`
- ‚úÖ Frontend: `https://________________________.vercel.app`
- ‚úÖ Database: PostgreSQL + Redis on Railway
