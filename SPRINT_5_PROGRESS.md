## 🔬 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Workflow Execution Flow
```
1. User triggers workflow run
2. WorkflowCompiler validates and compiles DAG
3. Create WorkflowRun record in DB
4. WorkflowRunner starts execution:
   a. For each execution level (parallel group):
      - Spawn async tasks for all nodes in level
      - Each node: resolve inputs → execute → store output
      - Handle retries with backoff
      - Stream events to WebSocket
   b. Update context with node outputs
   c. Continue to next level
5. Gather final output from terminal nodes
6. Update WorkflowRun status and results
```

### Node Input Binding Resolution
```python
# Example workflow context after node executions:
{
  "input": {"query": "Find hotels in SF"},
  "node_outputs": {
    "search_hotels": {"hotels": [...]},
    "filter_price": {"filtered": [...]}
  }
}

# Node input binding:
{
  "query": "$context.query",
  "hotels": "$search_hotels.hotels",
  "max_price": 200
}

# Resolves to:
{
  "query": "Find hotels in SF",
  "hotels": [...],
  "max_price": 200
}
```

### Parallel Execution Levels
```
Workflow DAG:
  A
 / \
B   C
 \ /
  D

Execution levels:
Level 0: [A]
Level 1: [B, C]  ← Run in parallel
Level 2: [D]
```

## 💪 SPRINT 5 STATUS: 40% Complete

**Core Engine:** ✅ Complete  
**API Layer:** ⏳ Not started  
**Frontend:** ⏳ Not started  
**Tests:** ⏳ Not started  
**Integration:** ⏳ Not started  

**Next commit should include:** Workflow API endpoints + WebSocket route

## 🚀 READY TO CONTINUE!

The foundation is solid. The workflow engine can:
- Validate complex DAGs
- Detect cycles and unreachable nodes
- Execute nodes in parallel
- Retry with backoff
- Stream real-time events
- Track costs and duration

Now we need the API layer to expose this to the frontend and users!
