3. "sfo" = San Francisco, "lax" = Los Angeles, "san" = likely San Diego/San Francisco (ask if unclear)
4. "25th to 31st" = valid dates, "cot" = "oct" (typo), "dec" = December
5. "$1000" or "1000 dollars" = valid budget
6. FIX TYPOS: "cot 25" ‚Üí "October 25", "nov 3rd" ‚Üí "November 3rd"
7. INCOMPLETE CITIES: "san" alone could be San Diego, San Francisco, or San Jose - ASK FOR CLARIFICATION
8. If user sends JUST a city name (like "san diego") after being asked a question, UPDATE the previous incomplete field

EXAMPLES:
‚ùå WRONG: User said "departing from sfo" ‚Üí you say "missing departure_location"
‚úÖ RIGHT: User said "departing from sfo" ‚Üí "departure_location": "San Francisco"

‚ùå WRONG: User said "from san to seattle" ‚Üí "departure_location": "San"
‚úÖ RIGHT: User said "from san to seattle" ‚Üí ASK "Did you mean San Diego, San Francisco, or San Jose?"

‚ùå WRONG: Previous msg: "from san", Current msg: "san diego" ‚Üí you ignore context
‚úÖ RIGHT: Previous msg: "from san", Current msg: "san diego" ‚Üí UPDATE "departure_location": "San Diego"

‚ùå WRONG: User said "just me" ‚Üí you say "missing num_travelers"
‚úÖ RIGHT: User said "just me" ‚Üí "num_travelers": 1

‚ùå WRONG: User said "1000 dollars usd" ‚Üí you say "missing budget"
‚úÖ RIGHT: User said "1000 dollars usd" ‚Üí "budget": "1000 USD"

‚ùå WRONG: User said "cot 25 to 31" ‚Üí "travel_dates": "cot 25 to 31"
‚úÖ RIGHT: User said "cot 25 to 31" ‚Üí "travel_dates": "October 25 to 31"

Now extract from the ENTIRE conversation history:

- departure_location: where user is flying FROM (ask if ambiguous like "san")
- travel_dates: any dates mentioned (ask if invalid/unclear)
- num_travelers: number of people ("just me"=1, "3 people"=3, "solo"=1)
