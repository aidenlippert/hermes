Analyze the request and conversation history thoroughly:

1. For TRAVEL requests, extract these details from ANYWHERE in the conversation:
   - Destination: Look for city/country names mentioned
   - Departure location: "from [city]", "departing from [city]", "[city] airport"
   - Travel dates: Any dates mentioned (Oct 28th, October 28-31, next week, etc.)
   - Number of travelers: "3 people", "me and my family", "solo trip", etc.
   - Budget: "$2000", "under 2000 usd", "budget friendly", etc.
   - Special requirements: dietary restrictions, accessibility, preferences

2. CAREFULLY check the conversation history - users often provide ALL information in their second message after being asked!

3. Only mark information as "missing" if it's TRULY not provided anywhere in the conversation.

4. If you have ALL required information, set "has_sufficient_info": true
