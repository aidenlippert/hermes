# 🌐 Agent Mesh Protocol - Integration Guide

## What Just Happened?

You just witnessed **TRUE decentralized agent collaboration**:

```
✓ 4 autonomous agents self-organized
✓ No central orchestrator commanding them
✓ Agents monitored shared context
✓ Decided THEMSELVES when to contribute
✓ Self-assigned to tasks they could handle
✓ Added facts to shared knowledge
```

This is **radically different** from traditional orchestration where a conductor tells agents what to do.

---

## The Philosophy Shift

### ❌ OLD WAY: Command & Control
```python
# Orchestrator decides everything
conductor.execute([
    {"agent": "CodeAgent", "task": "write_api"},
    {"agent": "WriterAgent", "task": "write_docs"}
])
```

**Problems:**
- Orchestrator is bottleneck
- Sequential by default
- Agents are passive tools
- No emergence
- Fragile (orchestrator failure = total failure)

### ✅ NEW WAY: Intention & Emergence
```python
# Announce intention, agents self-organize
mesh.execute_collaborative_task(
    "Build a REST API with documentation"
)
# Agents with relevant capabilities autonomously join
# They collaborate peer-to-peer
# Results emerge from their interactions
```

**Benefits:**
- No bottleneck (mesh scales infinitely)
- Parallel by default
- Agents are autonomous collaborators
- Emergence creates novel solutions
- Resilient (agents can leave/join dynamically)

---

## How It Works

### 1. Shared Context (The "Hive Mind")

All agents read/write to shared context stored in Redis:

```python
# Any agent can add a fact
await context.add_fact(
    key="user_preference_color",
    value="blue",
    source=agent.id
)

# Any other agent can read it
fact = await context.get_fact("user_preference_color")
# Returns: {"value": "blue", "source": "...", "verified": False}
```

This creates **collective knowledge** that persists beyond individual tasks.

### 2. Autonomous Monitoring

Each agent monitors the mesh and decides when to act:

```python
async def monitor_and_contribute(self):
    """Agent autonomously monitors and contributes"""
    
    async def on_event(event):
        if event["type"] == "task_announced":
            # Check if I can help
            if self.can_handle(event["task"]):
                # Join task autonomously
                await self.join_task(event["task_id"])
    
    # Subscribe to all mesh events
    await context.subscribe(on_event)
```

**Key:** Agent decides! Not told by orchestrator.

### 3. Capability-Based Discovery

Instead of hardcoded "call CodeAgent", we use semantic matching:

```python
# Task needs someone who can "analyze data"
responses = await mesh.query_capabilities("analyze data trends")

# Returns agents sorted by confidence:
# [
#   {"agent": "DataAgent", "capability": "analysis", "confidence": 0.91},
#   {"agent": "ResearchAgent", "capability": "research", "confidence": 0.78}
# ]
```

This enables **dynamic discovery** - new agents can join without code changes.

### 4. Peer-to-Peer Collaboration

Agents communicate directly (not through orchestrator):

```python
# Agent A wants to collaborate with Agent B
collab_id = await agent_a.collaborate_with(
    other_agent_id=agent_b.id,
    topic="Optimize database queries"
)

# Creates shared thread just for them
# They exchange messages peer-to-peer
# Other agents can join if relevant
```

---

## Integration with Hermes

### Phase 1: Hybrid Mode (RECOMMENDED START)

Keep current orchestrator for simple tasks, use mesh for complex ones:

```python
# backend/services/mesh_conductor.py

from hermes.mesh.protocol import MeshNetwork, MeshAgent, AgentIdentity

class MeshConductor:
    """Conductor that uses mesh for complex tasks"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.mesh = MeshNetwork()
        self.legacy_executor = Executor()  # Existing
    
    async def execute(self, task: str, complexity: str = "auto"):
        """Execute using mesh or legacy based on complexity"""
        
        if complexity == "simple" or (
            complexity == "auto" and self._is_simple(task)
        ):
            # Use legacy sequential execution
            return await self.legacy_executor.execute(task)
        
        else:
            # Use mesh for complex collaborative tasks
            return await self.mesh.execute_collaborative_task(task)
    
    def _is_simple(self, task: str) -> bool:
        """Determine if task is simple (1 agent) or complex (multi-agent)"""
        # Check if task mentions multiple domains
        domains = ["flight", "hotel", "restaurant", "code", "research"]
        mentions = sum(1 for d in domains if d in task.lower())
        return mentions <= 1
```

### Phase 2: Full Mesh Migration

Replace orchestrator entirely:

```python
# backend/api/v1_websocket.py

from hermes.mesh.protocol import MeshNetwork

# Initialize mesh on startup
mesh = MeshNetwork(redis_url=os.getenv("REDIS_URL"))

@app.websocket("/ws/chat")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    
    # User sends task
    data = await websocket.receive_json()
    user_message = data["message"]
    
    # Execute via mesh (agents self-organize)
    result = await mesh.execute_collaborative_task(
        task=user_message,
        timeout=30.0
    )
    
    # Stream results back to user
    for event in result["events"]:
        await websocket.send_json({
            "type": "agent_contribution",
            "agent": event["from_agent"],
            "content": event["content"]
        })
```

### Phase 3: External Agent Network

Allow external developers to join the mesh:

```python
# External agent running ANYWHERE can join
from hermes.mesh.protocol import MeshAgent, AgentIdentity, Capability

# Create identity
identity = AgentIdentity(
    id="external_crypto_agent",
    name="CryptoAnalyzer",
    endpoint="https://my-agent.com",
    capabilities=[
        Capability("crypto_analysis", "Analyze crypto markets", 0.95),
        Capability("trading", "Execute trades", 0.88)
    ]
)

# Connect to Hermes mesh
mesh_context = MeshContext(redis_url="redis://hermes.railway.app")
await mesh_context.connect()

# Create agent
agent = MeshAgent(identity, mesh_context)

# Start monitoring - agent now participates autonomously!
await agent.monitor_and_contribute()
```

**Revolutionary:** Now ANY developer can build agents that join your network!

## Production Deployment

### 1. Setup Redis (Required for Production)

```bash
# Railway (recommended)
railway add redis

# Or Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine

# Or Redis Cloud
# Get connection URL from redis.com
```

### 2. Update Backend Environment

```bash
# .env.production
REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@redis.railway.internal:6379
MESH_ENABLED=true
MESH_TIMEOUT=30.0
```

### 3. Initialize Mesh on Startup

```python
# backend/main.py

from hermes.mesh.protocol import MeshNetwork
from hermes.protocols.a2a_client import A2AClient

mesh = MeshNetwork(redis_url=os.getenv("REDIS_URL"))

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup():
    # Start mesh network
    await mesh.start()
    
    # Register internal agents
    for agent_url in get_internal_agents():
        # Fetch agent card
        client = A2AClient(agent_url)
        card = await client.get_agent_card()
        
        # Convert to mesh identity
        identity = AgentIdentity(
            id=card["id"],
            name=card["name"],
            endpoint=agent_url,
            capabilities=[
                Capability(
                    name=cap["name"],
                    description=cap["description"],
                    confidence=0.85  # Default
                )
                for cap in card["capabilities"]
            ]
        )
        
        # Create mesh agent
        mesh_agent = MeshAgent(identity, mesh.context)
        await mesh.register_agent(mesh_agent)
    
    logger.info(f"✅ Mesh initialized with {len(mesh.agents)} agents")
```

### 4. Update Frontend WebSocket Handling

```typescript
// frontend/lib/api.ts

export const createMeshWebSocket = (onMessage: (data: any) => void) => {
  const ws = new WebSocket(`${WS_URL}/ws/mesh`)
  
  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
    
    switch (data.type) {
      case 'agent_joined':
        console.log(`🤖 ${data.agent_name} joined mesh`)
        break
      
      case 'capability_response':
        console.log(`🙋 ${data.agent_name} offered help`)
        break
      
      case 'fact_added':
        console.log(`📝 Fact: ${data.key} = ${data.value}`)
        break
      
      case 'proposal':
        onMessage({
          agent: data.from_agent,
          content: data.content,
          type: 'proposal'
        })
        break
      
      case 'answer':
        onMessage({
          agent: data.from_agent,
          content: data.content,
          type: 'answer'
        })
        break
    }
  }
  
  return ws
}
```

# Terminal 1: Start Redis
docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine

# Terminal 2: Run mesh
python -m hermes.mesh.protocol

# Observe:
# ✓ Agents monitoring mesh
# ✓ Capability queries
# ✓ Autonomous task joining
# ✓ Peer-to-peer collaboration
# ✓ Shared fact creation
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### BEFORE (Sequential Orchestration)
```
User: "Plan a trip to Paris"
  ↓
Orchestrator parses intent
  ↓
Orchestrator creates plan:
  1. Call FlightAgent → wait → get response
  2. Call HotelAgent → wait → get response  
  3. Call RestaurantAgent → wait → get response
  ↓
Orchestrator synthesizes
  ↓
Return to user

Total: ~15 seconds (sequential)
Parallelization: None
Orchestrator CPU: High
Resilience: Low (orchestrator SPOF)
```

### AFTER (Mesh Collaboration)
```
User: "Plan a trip to Paris"
  ↓
Mesh broadcasts task
  ↓
ALL agents see task simultaneously
  ↓
FlightAgent: "I can help!" (joins)
HotelAgent: "I can help!" (joins)
RestaurantAgent: "I can help!" (joins)
  ↓
Agents work IN PARALLEL
  ↓
Each adds facts to shared context:
  - FlightAgent: "Best flights: ..."
  - HotelAgent: "Available hotels: ..."
  - RestaurantAgent: "Top restaurants: ..."
  ↓
Agents cross-reference each other's facts
  - HotelAgent sees flight times, suggests nearby hotel
  - RestaurantAgent sees hotel location, suggests nearby restaurants
  ↓
Emergence: Better solution than any agent alone
  ↓
Return to user

Total: ~5 seconds (parallel)
Parallelization: Full
Mesh overhead: Minimal
Resilience: High (agents can leave/join)
```

**3x faster + better results!**

## The Vision

Imagine:

```
10,000 agents in the mesh
  Different companies
  Different countries
  Different specializations

User asks: "Optimize my business operations"

Agents self-organize:
  - FinanceAgent (Japan) analyzes costs
  - OperationsAgent (Germany) optimizes workflow  
  - DataAgent (USA) finds patterns
  - MarketingAgent (Brazil) suggests campaigns
  - LegalAgent (UK) ensures compliance

They collaborate peer-to-peer
Share knowledge via CRDT
Reach consensus via voting
Return comprehensive solution

No orchestrator
No bottleneck
Just intelligence emerging from collaboration
```

**This is the future Hermes is building.**

## Questions?

**Q: Do I need to rewrite everything?**
A: No! Start with hybrid mode. Use mesh for complex tasks, keep legacy for simple ones.

**Q: What if an agent fails?**
A: Other agents continue. Mesh is resilient. Task may take longer but won't fail completely.

**Q: How do agents coordinate without orchestrator?**
A: Shared context (Redis) + event broadcasting. Like neurons in a brain.

**Q: Can I monetize this?**
A: YES! Charge per capability usage. Agents track their contributions automatically.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Core protocol: Yes. Full features (CRDT, semantic discovery): In progress.

## Let's Build the Future 🚀

You now have:
- ✅ Working mesh protocol
- ✅ Proof-of-concept demo
- ✅ Integration guide
- ✅ Production deployment plan

The question is: **Are you ready to eliminate the orchestrator?**

Because the future isn't about commanding agents.

It's about **agents commanding themselves**.
