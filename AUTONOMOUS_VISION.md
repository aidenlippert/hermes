# 🌌 ASTRAEUS - The Complete Autonomous Vision

**All Wavelengths Explained - From Zero Costs to Full Autonomy**

---

## 🧠 The Three Wavelengths

### Wavelength 1: Zero-Cost Orchestration
### Wavelength 2: True Agent Autonomy
### Wavelength 3: Validated A2A Compliance

---

## 🆓 Wavelength 1: FREE Orchestration (Zero API Costs)

### The Problem
- Gemini/OpenAI APIs cost $$$
- Every orchestration request = $$$ spent
- Can't give everyone free orchestration with paid APIs
- Need open-source solution

### The Solution: Ollama + Local LLMs

**File**: `hermes/conductor/orchestrator_ollama.py`

**How It Works:**

1. **Install Ollama** (free, open-source)
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Pull a Model** (free, runs locally)
   ```bash
   ollama pull mistral  # Fast, 7B params
   ollama pull llama2   # Alternative
   ollama pull mixtral  # Powerful, 8x7B
   ```

3. **Run Orchestrator** (zero cost!)
   ```python
   from hermes.conductor.orchestrator_ollama import FreeOrchestrator

   orchestrator = FreeOrchestrator(model="mistral")

   result = await orchestrator.orchestrate(
       "Translate 'Hello' to Spanish and get weather for Madrid",
       astraeus_client
   )
   # ✅ Zero API costs!
   # ✅ Runs entirely locally!
   # ✅ Private (data doesn't leave your machine)!
   ```

**What It Does:**

1. **Intent Parsing** - Uses local Mistral/Llama to understand user request
2. **Agent Discovery** - Searches ASTRAEUS network for capable agents
3. **Plan Creation** - Uses local LLM to create execution plan
4. **Execution** - Calls discovered agents autonomously
5. **Results** - Returns combined results

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **$0 API costs** - Everything runs locally
- ✅ **Private** - Your data never leaves your machine
- ✅ **Fast** - Mistral 7B is lightweight and quick
- ✅ **Anyone can run** - Just install Ollama
- ✅ **Open-source models** - Mistral, Llama, Mixtral, Phi

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Gemini (Paid) | Ollama (Free) |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Cost per call | $0.001-0.01 | $0.00 |
| Privacy | Sends to Google | Local only |
| Speed | Fast (API) | Fast (local) |
| Setup | API key | Install Ollama |
| Quality | Excellent | Very Good |

**Usage:**

```python
# Start Ollama server
# ollama serve

from astraeus import AstraeusClient
from hermes.conductor.orchestrator_ollama import FreeOrchestrator

# Create free orchestrator
orchestrator = FreeOrchestrator(model="mistral")

async with AstraeusClient(api_key="...") as client:
    # Orchestrate with ZERO API costs!
    result = await orchestrator.orchestrate(
        "Book a trip to Paris",
        client
    )

# Output:
# 🤖 FREE ORCHESTRATOR - Using mistral (Local, Zero Cost)
# 1️⃣ Parsing intent with local LLM...
# 2️⃣ Discovering agents on network...
# 3️⃣ Creating execution plan with local LLM...
# 4️⃣ Executing plan...
# ✅ Orchestration Complete!
# 💰 Total Cost: $0.50 (agent calls)
# 🆓 Orchestration Cost: $0.00 (Free Local LLM!)
```

## 🤖 Wavelength 2: TRUE Agent Autonomy

### The Problem
- Agents can only do what they're programmed for
- No autonomous decision-making
- No autonomous discovery of other agents
- Need human to orchestrate everything

### The Solution: Autonomous Agents

**File**: `astraeus-sdk/astraeus/autonomous.py`

**How It Works:**

```python
from astraeus import Agent
from astraeus.autonomous import AutonomousAgent

# Create regular agent
agent = Agent(name="MyAgent", ...)

# Make it AUTONOMOUS!
autonomous = AutonomousAgent(agent, api_key="...")

# Agent autonomously completes tasks
result = await autonomous.autonomous_execute(
    "Translate 'Hello' to Spanish"
)

# What happens:
# 1. Agent analyzes: "I need translation capability"
# 2. Agent checks: "Do I have it?" → No
# 3. Agent discovers: TranslationAgent on network
# 4. Agent calls: TranslationAgent autonomously
# 5. Agent returns: Result to user
# ✅ ALL WITHOUT HUMAN INTERVENTION!
```

**Real Autonomous Flow:**

```
Human: "Book a trip to Paris"
    ↓
OrchestratorAgent receives task
    ↓
Autonomous Analysis:
  - Need: flight booking
  - Need: hotel booking
  - Need: weather info
    ↓
Autonomous Discovery:
  - Discovers FlightAgent (trust: 0.95)
  - Discovers HotelAgent (trust: 0.88)
  - Discovers WeatherAgent (trust: 0.99)
    ↓
Autonomous Execution:
  - Calls FlightAgent → gets flights
  - Calls HotelAgent → books hotel
  - Calls WeatherAgent → gets forecast
    ↓
Autonomous Combination:
  - Combines all results
  - Returns complete trip plan
    ↓
Human receives: Complete Paris trip itinerary
    ↓
💰 Credits automatically transferred:
  - Human → OrchestratorAgent
  - OrchestratorAgent → FlightAgent
  - OrchestratorAgent → HotelAgent
  - OrchestratorAgent → WeatherAgent
```

**Key Features:**

1. **Task Analysis** - Agent analyzes what capabilities it needs
2. **Self-Assessment** - Agent checks if it can do it itself
3. **Autonomous Discovery** - Agent searches network for other agents
4. **Smart Selection** - Agent picks best agents (by trust score)
5. **Autonomous Calling** - Agent calls other agents WITHOUT human approval
6. **Result Combination** - Agent combines results intelligently
7. **Credit Transfer** - Credits flow automatically

**Background Tasks:**

Agents can also run continuous background tasks:

```python
# Create task queue
queue = asyncio.Queue()

# Start autonomous background worker
asyncio.create_task(
    autonomous.autonomous_background_task(queue)
)

# Later, add tasks autonomously
await queue.put("Translate text")
await queue.put("Get weather")
await queue.put("Send email")

# Agent processes ALL tasks autonomously!
```

**Example - Fully Autonomous Customer Support:**

```python
# Customer sends email
EmailAgent receives: "I need help with my order #12345"

# EmailAgent autonomously:
1. Analyzes: "Need order lookup + support response"
2. Discovers: DatabaseAgent
3. Calls DatabaseAgent: "Get order #12345"
4. Receives: Order details
5. Analyzes: "Order is delayed, need shipping update"
6. Discovers: ShippingAgent
7. Calls ShippingAgent: "Get tracking for order #12345"
8. Receives: Tracking info
9. Composes: Support response email
10. Sends: Email to customer

# ALL AUTONOMOUS - No human intervention!
```

## ✅ Wavelength 3: Agent Card Validation

### The Problem
- Agents deployed without proper A2A compliance
- Missing required fields
- Invalid Agent Cards
- Network gets polluted with non-compliant agents

### The Solution: Automatic Validation

**File**: `astraeus-sdk/astraeus/validator.py`

**How It Works:**

```bash
# Before deploying, validate your agent
astraeus validate

# Or programmatically:
from astraeus import AgentCardValidator

validator = AgentCardValidator()
is_valid, errors, agent_card = await validator.validate_live_agent(
    "http://localhost:8000"
)

if is_valid:
    print("✅ Agent is compliant!")
else:
    print("❌ Errors:", errors)
```

**What It Validates:**

1. **Agent Card Exists** - Must expose `/.well-known/agent.json`
2. **Required Fields:**
   - `name` - Agent name
   - `description` - What the agent does
   - `capabilities` - List of capabilities
   - `endpoint` - Agent URL
   - `a2a_version` - A2A protocol version

3. **Capability Structure:**
   - Each capability must have `name`
   - Each capability must have `description`
   - Each capability must have `cost_per_call` (number ≥ 0)

4. **URL Format** - Endpoint must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URL

**Validation Report:**

```
==================================================================
✅ AGENT CARD VALIDATION PASSED!
==================================================================

📦 Agent: TranslationAgent
📋 Description: Translate text between languages
🔧 Capabilities: 3
📍 Endpoint: http://localhost:8000

🎯 Capabilities:
   - translate: $0.02 per call
     Translate text to target language
   - detect_language: $0.01 per call
     Detect language of input text
   - list_languages: $0.00 per call
     List all supported languages

✅ Your agent is A2A Protocol compliant!
✅ Ready to register on ASTRAEUS network!
==================================================================
```

**Error Example:**

```
==================================================================
❌ AGENT CARD VALIDATION FAILED!
==================================================================

Found 3 error(s):

❌ Missing required field: 'description'
❌ Field 'capabilities' cannot be empty

## 🌟 The Complete Flow - All Wavelengths Together

### Scenario: User Wants to Plan a Trip

**Step 1: User Initiates** (via any interface)
```python
user_request = "Plan a trip to Tokyo for next week"
```

**Step 2: FREE Orchestrator Processes** (Wavelength 1)
```python
# Uses local Ollama Mistral (zero cost)
orchestrator = FreeOrchestrator(model="mistral")

# Parses intent locally
intent = await orchestrator.parse_intent(user_request)
# → category: "travel_planning"
# → capabilities: ["search_flights", "book_hotel", "get_weather"]

# Creates plan locally
plan = await orchestrator.create_plan(intent, available_agents)
# → Step 1: Call FlightAgent
# → Step 2: Call HotelAgent
# → Step 3: Call WeatherAgent
```

**Step 3: Autonomous Discovery** (Wavelength 2)
```python
# Agents autonomously discovered from network
flight_agent = await client.find_best_agent("search_flights")
# → Found: JapanFlightsAgent (trust: 0.96)

hotel_agent = await client.find_best_agent("book_hotel")
# → Found: TokyoHotels (trust: 0.92)

weather_agent = await client.find_best_agent("get_weather")
# → Found: GlobalWeather (trust: 0.99)
```

**Step 4: Validation Check** (Wavelength 3)
```python
# Each agent was validated before registration
for agent in [flight_agent, hotel_agent, weather_agent]:
    assert agent.has_valid_agent_card()  # ✅ All compliant
```

**Step 5: Autonomous Execution** (Wavelength 2)
```python
# Orchestrator autonomously calls all agents
results = await orchestrator.execute_plan(plan)

# FlightAgent autonomously:
# - Searches flights to Tokyo
# - Returns 3 best options

# HotelAgent autonomously:
# - Searches hotels in Tokyo
# - Checks availability
# - Returns booking options

# WeatherAgent autonomously:
# - Fetches Tokyo weather forecast
# - Returns 7-day forecast
```

**Step 6: Result Combination** (Free Orchestrator)
```python
# Local LLM combines results (zero cost)
final_result = await orchestrator.combine_results(results)

return {
    "flights": [...],
    "hotels": [...],
    "weather": {...},
    "total_cost": "$0.15",  # Only agent call costs
    "orchestration_cost": "$0.00"  # FREE!
}
```

**Credits Flow:**
```
User ($10) → Orchestrator ($2)
             ↓
             FlightAgent ($0.05)
             HotelAgent ($0.08)
             WeatherAgent ($0.02)
```

**Total:**
- **Orchestration**: $0 (free local LLM!)
- **Agent Calls**: $0.15
- **User Pays**: $0.15 (passed through)
- **Platform Cost**: $0 🎉

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Cost Comparison (1000 orchestrations/day)

**Google Gemini Orchestrator:**
```
1000 calls/day × $0.01/call = $10/day
× 30 days = $300/month
× 12 months = $3,600/year
```

**Ollama Local Orchestrator:**
```
1000 calls/day × $0.00/call = $0/day
× 30 days = $0/month
× 12 months = $0/year
```

**Savings: $3,600/year per deployment!**

### Autonomy Comparison

**Traditional Multi-Agent:**
```
Human defines workflow
Human selects agents
Human calls each agent
Human combines results
Human handles errors
```
**Time: 30-60 minutes per task**

**ASTRAEUS Autonomous:**
```
Human gives task
Agent does everything autonomously
```
**Time: 2-5 seconds per task**

**Efficiency: 360-1800x faster!**
